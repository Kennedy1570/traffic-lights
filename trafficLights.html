                Traffic Lights History
                </h2>
                <p>The history of traffic lights is a fascinating journey that spans several centuries and reflects the evolution of transportation and urban planning. Here is a brief history of traffic lights, highlighting key milestones and their impact on traffic management.</p>

                    <dt><strong>Before Traffic Lights:</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Up until the 1900s in the United States, police officers primarily manually directed traffic through a combination of using hand signals from towers which allowed them to get a good view of traffic. However, in some areas red and green gas powered lights were used.

                    <dt><strong>The Gas-Powered Traffic Light (1868):</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The first documented traffic control device resembling a modern traffic light was developed by J.P. Knight, a British railway engineer, in 1868.
                    Knight's design used gas lamps with red and green lights, operated manually by a police officer.

                    <dt><strong>Electric Traffic Lights (1912):</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The first electric traffic lights were installed in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1912. They were designed by Lester Wire, a police officer.
                    These early electric lights had only red and green signals and were manually operated.The idea of a yellow warning light hadn't been implemented yet, so to warn drivers of a pending light change, a loud buzzing noise was made between the transition of stop and go. These lights still required manual operation, but it wasn't long before that problem was fixed too.

                The yellow or amber signal was introduced to traffic lights in the 1920s to provide a transition period between red and green, improving safety and reducing accidents.

                    <dt><strong>Introduction of Automated Signals (1920s-1930s):</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        The next major milestone was the development of automated traffic signal systems,The first solution was to install microphones that would detect sound from oncoming traffic and signal the light to change color when necessary. This was quickly outwitted by drivers who used their horns to get the lights to change (and unwittingly cause accidents), so a 10-second delay was added to the process. When computer technology saw major advancements in the mid 20th century,This gave birth to the modern traffic light operation as we know it today. which used timers to control the changing of lights rather than manual operation.
                        Innovations in traffic signal technology led to more efficient traffic flow and reduced congestion.
